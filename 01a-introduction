I'm constantly getting emails and DMs from people who just can't grow their Twitter accounts.

- They've bought all the courses from the Twitter Growth gurus.
- They've followed all the expert advice
- They've created great, original content

Yet despite doing everything the so-called experts told them do to, they just can't move the needle. They just can't get their Twitter accounts to grow.

These honest, hard working content creators are legitimatelly depressed. They've invested time, effort and money into the platform and end up with very little to show for it. All while watching fluff accounts that send out 'as a developer' tweets gain hundreds of followers a day.

I suffered the same fate. I went through the same feelings of depression and defeat as I worked hard and played by the rules but never managed to get any traction on Twitter. 

Then I started to really investigate what the big #techtwitter accounts were doing to grow. I slowly uncovered the growth hacks, dirty tricks and often downright unethical strategies the big accounts used to grow followers.

It all started to make sense as to why honest content creators remained invisible, while the biggest platform spammers and manipulators were rewarded.

As I've share these secrets with people I've found their depression dissipates. They realize that their lack of growth was not because they failed to do something right, but instead, it was because a bunch of other accounts were doing things that most people would consider to be wrong.

People realize the issue isn't with them, but instead with the seedy tactics other people were using to drown their honest efforts out.

That's all this book is. It's not going to give you a secret on how to grow quickly on Twitter. It's simply going to reveal the shady practices the biggest #techtwitter accounts use to gain fame.
