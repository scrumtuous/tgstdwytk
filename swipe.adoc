It's easy to gain a thousand, ten thousand or even a hundred thousand followers on Twitter.

JK Moligna made a lot of money guaranteeing 10,000 followers to anyone who bought into his program, and he's not alone.

There are plenty of people out there charging CEOs and aspiring influencers $10,000 for 10,000 followers. 

Now that might seem like a lot of money, but it's worth it.

Just take @Chrisstaud and @Nikkisiapno. They used the best techniques in the Twitter Growth playbook to gain over 100,000 followers in less than a year, and they are now boasting of scaling their monthly monetization from $5000 a month to $20,000 a month.

There is a lot of money to be made on Twitter if you can grow followers and flame the fires of engagement. And it's not hard to do if you know the tricks.

The thing is, the accounts that grow using things like engagement groups, ghost writers, swipe files and recycled content don't want you to know about the tricks they use.

- Ghostwriters can make over a million dollars a year, so they will fight ruthlessly to protect their business model.

- Influencers who grew using tricks and shady tactics would lose influence if people realized their growth wasn't orgainic.

- Shysters who peddle fake 'twitter growth advice' would lose their business if people knew they didn't gain their followings honestly.

I personally have taken a lot of blowback for exposing the shady and unethical practices the biggest accounts on TechTwitter have used to grow. These people are ruthless when it comes to protecting their investments.

But I can be ruthless at exposing the truth, and that's what I plan to do here. Just be honest and truthful with you about how the biggest accounts in the fitness, technology, entreprenuership and self-improvement sectors grew their following.

The truth is always a great shield when the dishonest among us ruthlessly attack.

Selling Twitter growth advice is a hundred million dollar industry.

It's an easy industry to get into. Just open a Twitter account, use some Twitter growth tactics to quickly gain 10,000 or 20,000 followers, and then use that quick growth to sell a Gumroad product or Udemy course.

Of course, the people selling those products don't tell you what they really did to gain followers. Instead, they just rehash the same standard set of Twitter growth advice that is filled with lies, half-truth and strategies that quite frankly don't work.

I purchased a lot of Twitter growth courses, did extensive reading online and paid close attention every time a big account's ghostwriter wrote a thread about how to gain followers online. The advice was always the same:

- Tweet at least twice a day
- Interact and engage with people
- Undertweet the biggest accounts
- Optimize your profile
- Niche down into a subgenre
- Use hashtags effectively
- Craft original threads with unique hooks

I'm here to tell you none of that stuff works, and the big Twitter accounts taking money off people and feeding them this ineffective advice know it doesn't work.

Don't get me wrong, if you follow this advice you're likely to add a few followers a day. 

For new, organic accounts with less than 1000 followers, an amazing ratio of tweets to followers gained is 10 to 1. 

That means if you follow this advice and do 10 tweets and replies every day, you'll gain 7 followers a week.

In a month you might get lucky and gain 50.

In a year your ratio might improve or you might get a viral tweet and you'll grow to over 1000 followers.

And that's assuming you maintain a consistent, never-ending pace of 10 original and compelling tweets and replies a week.

It's an unsustainable pace, and the payback isn't worth the effort. It'd take 10 years at that pace to gain 10,000 followers.

The advice simply doesn't work, and if you investigate the big Twitter accounts selling this advice, you'll quickly realize they don't eat their own dog food. These are not the techniques they used to grow thier following.

By the way, that ratio will change over time. As your account grows to over 10,000 followers, the ratio of tweets to followers improves. 

Two established, organic accounts I respect greatly are @vlad_mihalcea and @starbuxman.

- Vlad is a power Twitter user and has 70K followers on 50K tweets, so it's just better than a 1:1 ratio
- Josh (@starbuxman) has 70K followers on 100K tweets, a ratio of 0.7:1

In contrast, @Nikkisiapno in her first year on Twitter gained 125K followers on only 7000 tweets, a ration of 17:1. 

Ratios that high should raise an eyebrow. I guarantee you will never get 17 followers for every one tweet following the Twitter growth advice specified above.

=== The 'Tweet Twice a Day' Myth

Every Twitter growth guru starts off by saying you have to tweet every single day, if not twice a day.

On the surface that's good advice. I mean, you can't hit a baseball out of the park if you don't step up to the plate. So I agree that to grow on Twitter you need to tweet. It's what the big Twitter growth experts leave out of that piece of advice that's important.

First, you need to know that the big accounts are not actually logging into Twitter every day and publishing tweets. They all use scheduling and automation tools.

The big TechTwitter accounts spend an afternoon every couple of months and schedule 30 to 60 days worth of tweets. They then close down their automation tool and let it run. It sends out two or three tweets a day for them and they don't have to worry about their daily cadence.

That shouldn't be a huge revelation. It just makes sense that if you're a Twitter power user you'd use a scheduling tool. But when I was new to Twitter I had no idea about things like FeedHive and TweetHunter. I thought everyone was logging in every day and diligently tweeting out from their laptop or their cellphone. I had no idea that the big accounts just clicked play on their scheduling tool at the start of every quarter.

Again, the use of scheduling tools to tweet every day isn't a huge revelation, but I do think it's noteworthy that all the Twitter Growth gurus tend to fail to mention it. But I understand why. The big influencers would lose their authenticity if people knew that it was a scheduling tool sending out all of those engagement tweets, making it look like they were active on the platform, all while they're on vacation somewhere rolling around in all the money they made selling Twitter growth courses to people.

Now the second issue I have with the 'tweet twice a day' advice is a lot more interesting than the first.

Implicit in the 'tweet twice a day' advice is the idea that you'd be producing original, engageing content, right? 

Wrong.

The biggest growth accounts on Twitter don't tweet out _original_ content every day. Instead, they just create 30 or 60 days of content and just put that all on repeat.

When I first got serious about Twitter, I had no idea how I was going to come up with two original tweets a day, 60 original tweets a month and over 700 original tweets a year. And I was certainly amazed at how all the fastest growing accounts on Twitter managed to maintain that pace. The fact is, they don't.

So that's one of the biggest tricks, and one of the most tightly guarded secrets, in the TechTwitter community.

Twitter users have a short memory, so there's no need to post original content. Just put together 60 days worth of tweets and then just click rewind and play every two months, and every time you do it you're 10,000 followers richer.

Just go to any of the fastest growing accounts in your favorite genre, look at some of their most popular tweets and do a search for that tweet under that account. 

This search on MadzaDev for his '7 no-code tools' tweet and you'll see tweeted "7 No-code tools to boost your workflow (10X productivity)" on:

- March 31th
- January 29th
- Dec 28th
- November 29th

A quick search also showed he tweeted his '7 FREE No-code tools to create websites in minutes (try them)' tweet on:

- March 1st
- January 1st
- December 9th

As you can see, the same tweet is being recycled every 30 to 60 days. And this is not a retweet. This is an attempt to make it seem like the account is posting brand new, original content.

image:01-madzadev-7-no-code.jpg

Here's @Chrisstaud tweeting out the same "Learn Python and SQL" tweet every 30 or 60 days.


image:01-chris-learn-python

As you can see, Nikki can get over half a million impressions when she posts here '7 Programming Tools' tweet, which is why she has that scheduled on repeat.

image:01-nikki-7-programming.jpg


What's amazing is that this type of grift goes back years and years with some accounts.

For example, Marko Denic has been tweeting out the same 'remote jobs' tweet pretty much every month for almost 3 years. Note that Marko updates the tweet with new icons and adds a new link every couple of years, but for all intents and purposes, it's the same tweet being sent out every month as though it was new and original content.

image:01-marko-new-remote-jobs

Similarly, you can see that Prathkum has been sending out the some derivation of his 'Learn for Free' tweet since 2020 as well, although you can see that he's edited it slightly over the past 3 years. This is another technique big accounts use which is called 'filtering' where you take a tweet and then change it sligtly and pretend like it's new, original content. All the big accounts do it.

image:01-prathkum-learn-for-free-new.jpg
image:01-prathkum-learn-for-free-old.jpg

 
For some tweets that work really well, some accounts will just tweet it out every week, rather than waiting 30 or 60 days.

For example, every week Madzadev tweets out asking if anyone has a LinkedIn account. Those post generate a massive amount of engagement.

However, I did notice that Madzadev deletes that tweet after it's been floated for a few days, so I can't show you the actual tweet history.

However, every single time Madzadev asks if any of his followers have a LinkedIn account, Nikkisiapno throws her profile at him. So you can look at Nikki's responses and see that Madzadev threw out the same 'do you have a LinkedIn' tweet on:

- January 26th
- January 31st
- February 7th
- February 21st
- March 15th

So I think we've established two things here:

1. The big accounts don't actually log in and tweet every day. They just schedule tweets months in advance.
2. The big accounts only have about 60 days of original content. They just post the same stuff month after month.

Signing up for a scheduling tool isn't a big deal, so that's not a big ask if someone is serious about becoming a Twitter star.

But what about that second point? You've still got to come up with 60 days worth of awesome tweets, right? 

Actually, no. No you don't. 

At least _they_ don't.

Let me introduce you to the concept of a Twitter swipe file. If you've never heard of one before, this is going to blow your mind. I know that when I found out about it a lot of the nonsense I saw go on in the TechTwitter space made a lot more sense to me.

A swipe file is a collection of the top, most effective tweets in a given Twitter genre.

People will keep an eye on the tweets that tend to get the most likes, retweets and engagement and copy them into a file. Eventually they get a collection of 50 to 100 tweets that seem to really resonate with people in their community.

Then, all they do is steal these tweets and post them as their own. A swipe file is a collection of tweets that you've stolen from other people that have been proven to get massive engagement.

In the TechTwitter community, the swipe file is well known and shared extensively amongst the top accounts and includes such classics as:

- Top Remote Jobs that Pay in USD!
- Learn for Free in 2023!
- Chrome extensions to 10x your productivity!
- XYZ Developer Roadmap!
- Certifications you can get for Free!
- GitHub Repositories to learn XYZ
- AI Tools to Save you Time
- XYZ is a free university
- Top 10 Git Commands!

All of the fastest growing accounts on TechTwitter just copy off this common swipe file, create 60 days worth of tweets, and then just schedule them. Well, maybe I should say 'their ghostwriter copies them', but that's a whole other issue.

The point is, the top names in TechTwitter are not out there creating new content. They're simply stealing other people's content and posting it as their own.

Now, I should make one thing clear - it's not always a word for word swipe.

JK Moligna, who built Tweet Hunter and earned hundreds of thousands of dollars ghost writing for Tweet Hunter clients, calls it _filtering_, not stealing.

What he does is take a tweet that has been super successful and change a thing or two. For example, on a tweet that says 'Learn for Free' he might change it to 'Learn for Free in 2023!' and perhaps change one of the links referenced in the tweet. The tweet is no longer _stolen._ It is now _filtered._

If you look at TechTwitter, you'll see that's what all of the big accounts do.

For example, Prathkum has been filtering the stolen 'remote jobs' tweet since 2020, but sometimes he will add wink emoji. It's not longer a copied tweet, but is instead contains customized original content!

images:02-prathkum-remote-emoji.jpg

As you can see, Marko Denic's creative contribution is adding different icons to the tweet and switching out a link or two to remove any evidence that he was copying from a swipe file.

02-marko-remote-emoji.jpg

02-madzadev-remote-emoji.jpg

Madzadev also has a real knack for adding emojis to the tweets he pulls off the swipe file. With a few new links and different icons, you can hardly see any similarities between this tweet and the ones by Marko, Prathkum and others.

With ChatGPT being able to create Twitter threads, ghostwriters who pull from the Twitter Swipe file, along with hard working TechTwitter influencers can easily turn swipe file tweets into threads.

Two of the best people at doing this are @ChrisStaud and @NikkiSiapno. 

You'll notice that they both posted the exact same tweet, although they sneakily _filtered_ the title so nobody knew they were using the same content:

- Nikki used _7 of the best sites to land a remote job in 2023_
- Chris used _7 sites to get a remote job that pays in USD:_

You will notice that while they changed the title, Nikki and Chris both posted the exact same content.

You will see this quite often with the big techtwitter account just repost each other's stuff word for word. It makes it easy to see which accounts are working together to create the illusion that they are prolific content creators.
