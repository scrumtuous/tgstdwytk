It's easy to gain a thousand, ten thousand or even a hundred thousand followers on Twitter.

JK Moligna made a lot of money guaranteeing 10,000 followers to anyone who bought into his program, and he's not alone.

There are plenty of people out there charging CEOs and aspiring influencers $10,000 for 10,000 followers. 

Now that might seem like a lot of money, but it's worth it.

Just take @Chrisstaud and @Nikkisiapno. They used the best techniques in the Twitter Growth playbook to gain over 100,000 followers in less than a year, and they are now boasting of scaling their monthly monetization from $5000 a month to $20,000 a month.

There is a lot of money to be made on Twitter if you can grow followers and flame the fires of engagement. And it's not hard to do if you know the tricks.

The thing is, the accounts that grow using things like engagement groups, ghost writers, swipe files and recycled content don't want you to know about the tricks they use.

- Ghostwriters can make over a million dollars a year, so they will fight ruthlessly to protect their business model.

- Influencers who grew using tricks and shady tactics would lose influence if people realized their growth wasn't orgainic.

- Shysters who peddle fake 'twitter growth advice' would lose their business if people knew they didn't gain their followings honestly.

I personally have taken a lot of blowback for exposing the shady and unethical practices the biggest accounts on TechTwitter have used to grow. These people are ruthless when it comes to protecting their investments.

But I can be ruthless at exposing the truth, and that's what I plan to do here. Just be honest and truthful with you about how the biggest accounts in the fitness, technology, entreprenuership and self-improvement sectors grew their following.

The truth is always a great shield when the dishonest among us ruthlessly attack.
